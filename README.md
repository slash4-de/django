#Django Model

The Django model is the “heart” of your Django application. It represents your data in a very clean and clear way. From this model, Django can automatically create your database and a powerful admin GUI that can handle all sorts of insert, update and delete actions.

Let’s take a simple example. Imagine you want to build an “Employee Database” for your company. The requirements are:

- It should have an online Web GUI to enter new employees, update existing ones, delete ones leaving the company and create lists of all employes.
- It should have a user and session management (you have to login to enter new employees).
- It should have complex search functions (searching, filtering, ordering etc.).
- It should sanitize all input parameters for valid type and length and implement best security practices.
- An employee has a name, an email, gender, job title, salary and a birthdate.

How long does it take to build this application - including Database design, web frontend etc.? Days? Hours? Minutes?

With Django - in this very simple example - we are talking about minutes. All you have to do is to define your model - and the rest comes for free ...
